This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like "s" or "xn1" or "xn2") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like "boxShadow_xn1" and "boxShadow_xn2") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.
			 * This method returns an object that has the following properties:
			 *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.  This is what we feed to the external _onInitTween() as the target
			 *  - end: a generic object containing the ending values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin. This is what we feed to the external plugin's _onInitTween() as the destination values
			 *  - firstMPT: the first MiniPropTween in the linked list
			 *  - pt: the first CSSPropTween in the linked list that was created when parsing. If shallow is true, this linked list will NOT attach to the one passed into the _parseToProxy() as the "pt" (4th) parameter.
			 * @param {!Object} t target object to be tweened
			 * @param {!(Object|string)} vars the object containing the information about the tweening values (typically the end/destination values) that should be parsed
			 * @param {!CSSPlugin} cssp The CSSPlugin instance
			 * @param {CSSPropTween=} pt the next CSSPropTween in the linked list
			 * @param {TweenPlugin=} plugin the external TweenPlugin instance that will be handling tweening the numeric values
			 * @param {boolean=} shallow if true, the resulting linked list from the parse will NOT be attached to the CSSPropTween that was passed in as the "pt" (4th) parameter.

			/**
			 * @constructor Each property that is tweened has at least one CSSPropTween associated with it. These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of "extra" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where "s" indicates string and "n" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be "5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.
			 * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):
			 *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.
			 *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)
			 *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.
			 *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.
			 *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.
			 * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.
			 * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be "width".
			 * @param {number} s Starting numeric value
			 * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.
			 * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.
			 * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:"1px solid red"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.
			 * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a "clip:rect(...)" tween in which case "p" might be xs1 but "n" is still "clip"
			 * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded
			 * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority CSSPropTweens will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.
			 * @param {string=} b Beginning value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what it was when the tween began without any risk of interpretation issues.
			 * @param {string=} e Ending value. We store this to ensure that it is EXACTLY what the user defined at the end of the tween without any risk of interpretation issues.

			 * It will walk through the beginning and ending values (which should be in the same format with the same number and type of values) and figure out which parts are numbers, what strings separate the numeric/tweenable values, and then create the CSSPropTweens accordingly. If a plugin is defined, no child CSSPropTweens will be created. Instead, the ending values will be stored in the "data" property of the returned CSSPropTween like: {s:-5, xn1:-10, xn2:-20, xn3:255, xn4:0, xn5:0} so that it can be fed to any other plugin and it'll be plain numeric tweens but the recomposition of the complex value will be handled inside CSSPlugin's setRatio().
			 * If a setRatio is defined, the type of the CSSPropTween will be set to 2 and recomposition of the values will be the responsibility of that method.
			 *
			 * @param {!Object} t Target whose property will be tweened
			 * @param {!string} p Property that will be tweened (its name, like "left" or "backgroundColor" or "boxShadow")
			 * @param {string} b Beginning value
			 * @param {string} e Ending value
			 * @param {boolean} clrs If true, the value could contain a color value like "rgb(255,0,0)" or "#F00" or "red". The default is false, so no colors will be recognized (a performance optimization)
			 * @param {(string|number|Object)} dflt The default beginning value that should be used if no valid beginning value is defined or if the number of values inside the complex beginning and ending values don't match
			 * @param {?CSSPropTween} pt CSSPropTween instance that is the current head of the linked list (we'll prepend to this).
			 * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order. Higher priority properties will be updated before lower priority ones. The default priority is 0.

However, the end values WILL be populated in the "data" property, like {s:100, xn1:50, xn2:300}
			 * @param {function(number)=} setRatio If values should be set in a custom function instead of being pieced together in a type:1 (complex-value) CSSPropTween, define that custom function here.

Every SpecialProp is associated with a particular property name like "boxShadow" or "throwProps" or "bezier" and it will intercept those values in the vars object that's passed to the CSSPlugin and handle them accordingly.
		 * @param {!string} p Property name (like "boxShadow" or "throwProps")
		 * @param {Object=} options An object containing any of the following configuration options:
		 *                      - defaultValue: the default value
		 *                      - parser: A function that should be called when the associated property name is found in the vars. This function should return a CSSPropTween instance and it should ensure that it is properly inserted into the linked list. It will receive 4 paramters: 1) The target, 2) The value defined in the vars, 3) The CSSPlugin instance (whose _firstPT should be used for the linked list), and 4) A computed style object if one was calculated (this is a speed optimization that allows retrieval of starting values quicker)
		 *                      - formatter: a function that formats any value received for this special property (for example, boxShadow could take "5px 5px red" and format it to "5px 5px 0px 0px red" so that both the beginning and ending values have a common order and quantity of values.)
		 *                      - prefix: if true, we'll determine whether or not this property requires a vendor prefix (like Webkit or Moz or ms or O)

		 *                      - multi: if true, the formatter should accommodate a comma-delimited list of values, like boxShadow could have multiple boxShadows listed out.
		 *                      - collapsible: if true, the formatter should treat the value like it's a top/right/bottom/left value that could be collapsed, like "5px" would apply to all, "5px, 10px" would use 5px for top/bottom and 10px for right/left, etc.
		 *                      - keyword: a special keyword that can [optionally] be found inside the value (like "inset" for boxShadow). This allows us to validate beginning/ending values to make sure they match (if the keyword is found in one, it'll be added to the other for consistency by default).

		 * Registers a special property that should be intercepted from any "css" objects defined in tweens. This allows you to handle them however you want without CSSPlugin doing it for you. The 2nd parameter should be a function that accepts 3 parameters:
		 *  1) Target object whose property should be tweened (typically a DOM element)
		 *  2) The end/destination value (could be a string, number, object, or whatever you want)
		 *  3) The tween instance (you probably don't need to worry about this, but it can be useful for looking up information like the duration)
		 *
		 * Then, your function should return a function which will be called each time the tween gets rendered, passing a numeric "ratio" parameter to your function that indicates the change factor (usually between 0 and 1). For example:
		 *
		 * CSSPlugin.registerSpecialProp("myCustomProp", function(target, value, tween) {
		 *      var start = target.style.width;
		 *      return function(ratio) {
		 *              target.style.width = (start + value * ratio) + "px";
		 *              console.log("set width to " + target.style.width);
		 *          }
		 * }, 0);
		 *
		 * Then, when I do this tween, it will trigger my special property:
		 *
		 * TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}});
		 *
		 * In the example, of course, we're just changing the width, but you can do anything you want.
		 *
		 * @param {!string} name Property name (or comma-delimited list of property names) that should be intercepted and handled by your function. For example, if I define "myCustomProp", then it would handle that portion of the following tween: TweenLite.to(element, 1, {css:{myCustomProp:100}})
		 * @param {!function(Object, Object, Object, string):function(number)} onInitTween The function that will be called when a tween of this special property is performed. The function will receive 4 parameters: 1) Target object that should be tweened, 2) Value that was passed to the tween, 3) The tween instance itself (rarely used), and 4) The property name that's being tweened. Your function should return a function that should be called on every update of the tween. That function will receive a single parameter that is a "change factor" value (typically between 0 and 1) indicating the amount of change as a ratio. You can use this to determine how to set the values appropriately in your function.
		 * @param {number=} priority Priority that helps the engine determine the order in which to set the properties (default: 0). Higher priority properties will be updated before lower priority ones.

		 *  - If I create a tween of elementA, that tween instance may suddenly change its target to include 50 other elements (unintuitive if I specifically defined the target I wanted)
		 *  - We can't just create new independent tweens because otherwise, what happens if the original/parent tween is reversed or pause or dropped into a TimelineLite for tight control? You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.
		 *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.

			 * @constructor
			 * Defines a GreenSock class, optionally with an array of dependencies that must be instantiated first and passed into the definition.
			 * This allows users to load GreenSock JS files in any order even if they have interdependencies (like CSSPlugin extends TweenPlugin which is
			 * inside TweenLite.js, but if CSSPlugin is loaded first, it should wait to run its code until TweenLite.js loads and instantiates TweenPlugin
			 * and then pass TweenPlugin to CSSPlugin's definition). This is all done automatically and internally.
			 *
			 * Every definition will be added to a "com.greensock" global object (typically window, but if a window.GreenSockGlobals object is found,
			 * it will go there as of v1.7). For example, TweenLite will be found at window.com.greensock.TweenLite and since it's a global class that should be available anywhere,
			 * it is ALSO referenced at window.TweenLite. However some classes aren't considered global, like the base com.greensock.core.Animation class, so
			 * those will only be at the package like window.com.greensock.core.Animation. Again, if you define a GreenSockGlobals object on the window, everything
			 * gets tucked neatly inside there instead of on the window directly. This allows you to do advanced things like load multiple versions of GreenSock
			 * files and put them into distinct objects (imagine a banner ad uses a newer version but the main site uses an older one). In that case, you could
			 * sandbox the banner one like:
			 *
			 * <script>
			 *     var gs = window.GreenSockGlobals = {}; //the newer version we're about to load could now be referenced in a "gs" object, like gs.TweenLite.to(...). Use whatever alias you want as long as it's unique, "gs" or "banner" or whatever.
			 * </script>
			 * <script src="js/greensock/v1.7/TweenMax.js"></script>
			 * <script>
			 *     window.GreenSockGlobals = null; //reset it back to null so that the next load of TweenMax affects the window and we can reference things directly like TweenLite.to(...)
			 * </script>
			 * <script src="js/greensock/v1.6/TweenMax.js"></script>
			 * <script>
			 *     gs.TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.7
			 *     TweenLite.to(...); //would use v1.6
			 * </script>
			 *
			 * @param {!string} ns The namespace of the class definition, leaving off "com.greensock." as that's assumed. For example, "TweenLite" or "plugins.CSSPlugin" or "easing.Back".
			 * @param {!Array.<string>} dependencies An array of dependencies (described as their namespaces minus "com.greensock." prefix). For example ["TweenLite","plugins.TweenPlugin","core.Animation"]
			 * @param {!function():Object} func The function that should be called and passed the resolved dependencies which will return the actual class for this definition.
			 * @param {boolean=} global If true, the class will be added to the global scope (typically window unless you define a window.GreenSockGlobals object)
