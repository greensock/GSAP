    "description": "GSAP is a JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations that work in **every** major browser (or beyond the browser). No other library delivers such advanced sequencing, reliability, API efficiency, and tight control while solving real-world problems on over 4 million sites. GSAP works around countless browser inconsistencies; your animations 'just work'. Animate CSS properties, SVG, canvas libraries, custom properties of generic objects, colors, strings...pretty much anything! At its core, GSAP is a property manipulator, updating values over time very quickly with extreme accuracy. And it's up to 20x faster than jQuery! See http://greensock.com/why-gsap/ for details about what makes GSAP so special.",
